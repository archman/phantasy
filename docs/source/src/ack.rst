The ``phantasy`` python package is created and refactored based on
``phyapps`` and ``phyhlc`` package, many people have evolved in the
development:

* Dylan Maxwell, Guobao Shen, Linyun Yang (BNL): initial codebase of ``phyhlc``;
* Harry He, Kei Fukushima: design and prototype physics algorithms;
* Tong Zhang, built ``phyapps`` and created ``phantasy``, currently working
  on the latter to make it work on the future accelerator machine (e.g. FRIB).
