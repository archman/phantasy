Modeling Accelerator with Lattice File
======================================

`FLAME`_ is a new envelope tracking code developed by FRIB for the 
purpose of modeling (ion) accelerator efficiently, especially cases
of multi-charge states could be right handled, now it is still under 
development.

FLAME itself has python interface with the package name of ``flame``.
One of the module of ``phantasy`` --- ``flameutils`` is created 
not only to make the python interface more friendly and clear, 
but also to better support the entire high-level physics applications,
which is a part of high-level controls systems.
